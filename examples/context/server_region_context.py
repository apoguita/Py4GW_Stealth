"""ServerRegion — the region the client is connected to.

Three ways to read a context:

    print(context)        # the whole structure at a glance, values decoded
    context.<field>       # one field, exactly as the source layout declares it
    context.to_dict()     # every field as plain Python data, for code

This script prints ``region id``.

A single signed region value, resolved through its own signature.

See README.md in this folder for the other contexts, the ``None`` cases, and
the full list of access styles.
